I completely agree with the PDF files interrupt a users experience, as many a times I have received a phone call from my mum asking how to save or print a PDF as she can't read it online due to the poor layout of it. But yes I find PDFs do work well for big files like manuals. 
With the links changing colour its something I have not really given a lot of thought to before, as when I am browsing the web I don't tend to think about it or notice it.
With number 7, it made me think how many images/pieces of information that I have missed as I just miss took them as an advertisement and just scrolled past them...
9 has it bang on, I absolutely hate it when a new window opens! Just open in the existing window or a new tab thanks.

Interesting read that list was.
