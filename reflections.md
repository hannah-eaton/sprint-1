That was a heavy video. I feel as thought within the past couple of years I have been a lot more critical, and self 
sabotaging myself. I guess I never really thought about where these thoughts I was/am having were influenced from, till now. 
I have a lot of thinking to do.

Privilege
I feel when most people think of privilege, they think of wealth but I think privileged can mean many different things other than monetary.
